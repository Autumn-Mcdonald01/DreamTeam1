      <h3 class="enrollmentContentHeader">Eligibility</h3>
      <p>
        Beginning with the 2020-2021 school year, students will be eligible to <br>
        join National Honor Society as sophomores or juniors. Students must have <br>
        a minimum 3.25 GPA and have completed the required number of community <br>
        service hours (20 for sophomores, 40 for juniors). All eligible students <br>
        will receive an invitation to apply for membership.
      </p>

      <h3 class="enrollmentContentHeader">Selection</h3>
      <p>
        Students must complete an application that includes information about <br>
        their community service and leadership activities as well academic <br>
        achievements. Students also write a brief response explaining how they <br>
        uphold the NHS pillars. Candidate applications are reviewed by a member <br>
        faculty council. The chapter sponsor and co-sponsors have no part in the <br>
        selecton of new members. Faculty council members score applications <br>
        using a rubric. Students that meet all criteria will be issued a <br>
        membership invitation.
      </p>

      <h3 class="enrollmentContentHeader">Induction</h3>
      <p>
        New members are inducted in a ceremony. Families, teachers, and <br>
        community members are invited to attend. New members will receive a NHS <br>
        membership pin.
      </p>
      </div>
      <div class="membership-obs">
      <h1 class="enrollmentSectionHeader">Membership Obligations</h1> <!-- Section Two-->
      <p>
        <em>All duly inducted members must abide by the following constitutional
        obligations:</em>
      </p>
      <h3 class="enrollmentContentHeader">Dues</h3>
      <p>
        Students selected for membership are asked to pay annual dues in the <br>
        amount of $20. We are a small, growing chapter, and dues help cover the <br>
        cost of induction ceremonies, the annual chapter fee paid to National <br>
        Honor Society, and other activities as needed. If a student is unable to <br>
        meet this obligation, the chapter adviser should be notified as soon as <br>
        possible.
      </p>
      <h3 class="enrollmentContentHeader">Maintain Chapter Standards</h3>
      <p>
        Once inducted, students must continue to maintain the standards of the <br>
        chapter. Students must maintain or exceed a 3.25 GPA. Academic <br>
        eligibility will be reviewed at the end of each semester. Students must <br>
        also continue to meet or exceed the community service requirements. <br>
        Students must continue to demonstrate exemplary leadership and character <br>
        in both school and the community.
      </p>
      <h3 class="enrollmentContentHeader">Meetings</h3>
      <p>
        Students are required to attend all chapter meetings. NHS meets on the <br>
        first Friday of each month and at other times as determined to be <br>
        necessary. Students will be given adequate notice of additional meetings <br>
        times and should make every effort to attend. If attendance is not <br>
        possible, the student must notify the chapter adviser as soon as <br>
        possible. Students are responsible for obtaining any information missed. <br>
      </p>
      <h3 class="enrollmentContentHeader">Service Projects</h3>
      <p>
        The chapter will sponsor at least one service project a year. Members <br>
        are expected to actively participate in the planning and execution of <br>
        the project. Members are also expected to perform additional service <br>
        according to their own talents and interests. Records of service <br>
        activities should be submitted to the chapter adviser in a timely <br>
        manner.
