      <h1 class="enrollmentSectionHeader">Enrollment Information</h1> <!-- Section One-->

      <h3 class="enrollmentContentHeader">Eligibility:</h3>
      <p>
        Beginning with the 2020-2021 school year, students will be eligible to
        join National Honor Society as sophomores or juniors. Students must have
        a minimum 3.25 GPA and have completed the required number of community
        service hours (20 for sophomores, 40 for juniors). All eligible students
        will receive an invitation to apply for membership.
      </p>

      <h3 class="enrollmentContentHeader">Selection:</h3>
      <p>
        Students must complete an application that includes information about
        their community service and leadership activities as well academic
        achievements. Students also write a brief response explaining how they
        uphold the NHS pillars. Candidate applications are reviewed by a member
        faculty council. The chapter sponsor and co-sponsors have no part in the
        selecton of new members. Faculty council members score applications
        using a rubric. Students that meet all criteria will be issued a
        membership invitation.
      </p>

      <h3 class="enrollmentContentHeader">Induction:</h3>
      <p>
        New members are inducted in a ceremony. Families, teachers, and
        community members are invited to attend. New members will receive a NHS
        membership pin.
      </p>

      <h1 class="enrollmentSectionHeader">Membership Obligations:</h1> <!-- Section Two-->
      <p>
        <em>All duly inducted members must abide by the following constitutional
        obligations:</em>
      </p>
      <h3 class="enrollmentContentHeader">Dues:</h3>
      <p>
        Students selected for membership are asked to pay annual dues in the
        amount of $20. We are a small, growing chapter, and dues help cover the
        cost of induction ceremonies, the annual chapter fee paid to National
        Honor Society, and other activities as needed. If a student is unable to
        meet this obligation, the chapter adviser should be notified as soon as
        possible.
      </p>
      <h3 class="enrollmentContentHeader">Maintain Chapter Standards:</h3>
      <p>
        Once inducted, students must continue to maintain the standards of the
        chapter. Students must maintain or exceed a 3.25 GPA. Academic
        eligibility will be reviewed at the end of each semester. Students must
        also continue to meet or exceed the community service requirements.
        Students must continue to demonstrate exemplary leadership and character
        in both school and the community.
      </p>
      <h3 class="enrollmentContentHeader">Meetings:</h3>
      <p>
        Students are required to attend all chapter meetings. NHS meets on the
        first Friday of each month and at other times as determined to be
        necessary. Students will be given adequate notice of additional meetings
        times and should make every effort to attend. If attendance is not
        possible, the student must notify the chapter adviser as soon as
        possible. Students are responsible for obtaining any information missed.
      </p>
      <h3 class="enrollmentContentHeader">Service Projects:</h3>
      <p>
        The chapter will sponsor at least one service project a year. Members
        are expected to actively participate in the planning and execution of
        the project. Members are also expected to perform additional service
        according to their own talents and interests. Records of service
        activities should be submitted to the chapter adviser in a timely
        manner.
