# Dream Team - National Honor Society Website
DevCatalyst Coding Project

  JCM-ECH is home to a growing National Honor Society (NHS) chapter. This website is meant to be an information point for both current members and potential members. The client provided as much information as possible, including NHS guidelines, group photos, and most importantly, her input on various features of the website.

  At first, the only things the client requested were that the design follow the school colors, and that it have the NHS logo located on every page. After that requirement was met, there was a lot of freedom with the layout and organization. Per the client's request, the color theme is the same as JCM-ECH school colors, yellow and green. As the site is meant to provide information, it uses serif fonts, and has a flat design. 

  Although most of the website was done cooperatively, there are certain parts that were worked on almost completely individually;
Solomon: The calendar and the back to top arrow.
Autumn: The flexbox arrangements for images in the different media queries.

  Although most of the website is straightforward, the work done became very difficult in some cases, and some smaller details of the website might be overlooked. This includes details such as:  
    •	The page links in the navbar gain a shadow when the page is desktop sized
    •	The video used on the last page is also present on our school's facebook page
    •	The "Members and Leaders" title on the second page contains links
    • When the buttons in the footer change to the square shape on the mobile layout, 
    it's a different image than the one used in the bigger layout.
    • When clicking on the email links, it opens an email with the subject "National Honor Society"
    • The table changes background colors on the smaller view for easier reading
  
  Working on the website without having school as a communication point was difficult, but overall it turned out almost entirely as planned. We are very thankful to have been given the opportunity to participate in the DevCatalyst project, and we hope that you enjoy your experience with our website.
