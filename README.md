# Dream Team - National Honor Society Website
DevCatalyst Coding Project

Our website is meant to be an information point for members of the JCM National Honor Society chapter. Per our client's request, the color theme is the same as our school colors. As it is meant to provide information, we used serif fonts to fit the theme.
